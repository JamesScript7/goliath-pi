### 4 Areas

Product Area
Aux Area
Kitchen Area
Main Area

### The Board
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
(one generation behind the current)

### Why 3 B+ not the 4?
First generation to have onboard Bluetooth 4.2
Also first to have onboard, 5GHz WLAN (what we currently use)
Good enough processing power
Price, on amazon, the pi 3 B+ kit is $59.99, compared to pi 4 B kit which is $62.99.

### Minimum Cost
The kit: $59.99 * 4
Comes with a case, power supply, and cooling.
